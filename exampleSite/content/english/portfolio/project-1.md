#### Project Details

To streamline the software development process, I created a sufficient CI/CD pipeline by leveraging the capabilities of Docker Compose. Using Docker Compose, I was able to launch containers for various tools such as Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube}, and GitLab. This allowed me to automate the entire pipeline, from building and testing the code (Generated by Jhipster Angular + Springboot) to deploying it to the production environment.


#### Project Requirements

* Docker
* Docker-compose
