#### Project Details

To streamline the software development process, I created an efficient CI/CD pipeline by leveraging the capabilities of Docker Compose. Using Docker Compose, I launched containers for various tools, such as Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, and GitLab. This allowed me to automate the entire pipeline, from building and testing the code (generated by JHipster using Angular and Spring Boot) to deploying it to the production environment.


#### Project Requirements

* Docker
* Docker-compose
