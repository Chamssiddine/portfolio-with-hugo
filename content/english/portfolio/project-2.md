#### Project Details

My project aims to move the entire development process to the cloud and eliminate the hassle and time wasted on manual setup of the development environment. This will facilitate the integration of new developers into the teams. With the help of VSCODE and the Remote-SSH extension, developers will only need to connect to the cloud environment, and they'll be ready to work.


#### Project Requirements

* Terraform
* GCP Account
* Linux/Unix OS(preferably)
* HUGO Framework
